# batch-tools

Hello! This is my basic collection of batch tools I have created **so far**. Feel free to use these and modify them. My only request is **linking here if you redistribute this software**. These were made with little programming experience and no creativity so if you have any suggestions, please contact me!



## FindDownloadSource

FindDownloadSource is a simple batch tool that will find the location that a file was downloaded from. Note: this ***ONLY*** works on NTFS drives. Note 2: This program reads/writes to/deletes a file named `.temp` while working.

Run the command `finddownloadsource <file name>` to get the location that the file was downloaded from.
